## Description
This 2D RPG was meant to be a representation of all the skills I had accquired by the time I started the project. The game is a simple 2D action "RPG" where the core gameplay is reminiscent of early Zelda games or 2D "shoot'em ups," but with the levels being a sets of randomly generated rooms based on presents read from a sprite map. The game is meant to have a linear progression in difficultly, where with each level completed the length of the next level is increased. The player is also able to purchase different equipment at the start of each level, the equipment, along with accquired skill, being the main way a player's strength is progressed.
